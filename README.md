# Simulating-Chutes-and-Ladders
Code for simulating Chutes and Ladders. 

This is the code for my [blog post](http://joeystanley.com/blog/simulating_chutes_and_ladders) on Simulating Chutes and Ladders. The data, code, and images are all here. Note that there may be some minor textual differences between the blog post and the Rmd file here because the proofreading and edits are done on the website and not on the Rmd once I've copied it over.
